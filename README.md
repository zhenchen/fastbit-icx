fastbit-icx
===========

Apply ICX to work with WAH in bitmap index for FastBit. FastBit is a successful archival data management software using bitmap index to accerlate the query speed.

ICX is a new bitmap index encoding algorithm, it is a descent of COMPAX with newly designed codebook. ICX is the abbreviation of Improved COMPressed Adaptive indeX. In Chinese, it is named as "改进的压缩自适应索引."

ICX performs better compression ratio and fast encoding speed compared with the state-of-the-art bitmap index compression schemes, such as WAH (Word-Aligned-Hybrid), PLWAH(Position list word aligned hybrid) and COMPAX (COMPressed Adaptive indeX).

A detailed survey is introduced in the following paper.
